# CreditCard-Validator
This is a simple C++ program that validates credit card numbers using the Luhn Algorithm. It also provides a basic input masking feature to enhance user privacy by censoring most of the credit card number digits.

How it Works
The program takes a user's credit card number as input and validates it using the Luhn Algorithm, a widely used checksum formula. The Luhn Algorithm checks the validity of a credit card number by verifying its mathematical consistency. If the input card number is valid, the program displays a message indicating its validity. Additionally, the program censors most of the digits of the credit card number, displaying only the last four digits, to enhance user privacy.

Features
Validates credit card numbers using the Luhn Algorithm.
Masks most of the credit card digits for user privacy.
Simple and easy-to-use interface.
Usage
Run the program.
Enter your credit card number when prompted.
The program will censor most of the digits and validate the entered credit card number.
See the validation result in the console output.
